# sendme

This is a command-line app intended to host a temporary web server to let someone else transfer text or a file. I plan to make it automatically use [Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) so that it can output a URL that anyone on the internet can open.

Desired feature list:

- [ ] text sharing
- [ ] room code/password or something
- [ ] file sharing
- [ ] tailscale
- [ ] progress bar
